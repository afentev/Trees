# Trees
Trees visualization tool written on C++ &amp; Qt.

Program provides user interface and classes for Binary search tree, AVL tree, Red-black tree, Randomized binary search tree, 2-3 tree and min-heap.

There is a possibility of adding/removing n random vertexes from tree, scaling and moving the canvas, adding/removing one specific vertex and update vertex's value.

You can view some statistics about tree and switch from different types of trees without losing information about vertexes.

Vertexes in these trees are non-duplicate integers from -10^9 to 10^9.
